## Overview {.unnumbered}

This vignette provides an overview of how to conduct a principal component 
analysis (PCA). PCA is a statistical method used to compress high-dimensional 
(>3) data and retain the most informative aspects. This is done by finding the 
directions of maximum variance in the original high-dimensional data and 
projecting it onto a lower-dimensional space while collating highly correlated 
variables together (and retaining most of the information).

## Introduction {.unnumbered}

Principal component analysis is a linear transformation method used to analyze, 
identify patterns, and draw conclusions from more than three variables. For 
example, we could ask what contributes to a longer lifespan in humans from a 
data set that includes over 200 variables. To draw conclusions about human 
longevity, we first need to visualize and analyze this data set. Visualizing in 
more than three dimensions is difficult, thus visualizing human lifespan with 
200 variables (dimensions) cannot be done. PCAs take all factors (variables), 
combine them in a smart way, and produce new factors that are [1] correlated 
with each other and [2] ranked from most important to least important. The new 
factors produced by PCA are called **principal components**. Principal component 
1 (PC1) explains the greatest amount of the data set, followed by principal 
component 2 (PC2), which explains the next largest portion of the data set, and 
onward. In the example about human longevity, 200 variables associated with 
lifespan can be condensed down to 5 principal components.

#### How does a PCA pick its components? 

PCA asks the question "How can we arrange these data to preserve as much 
information as possible?" This results in an optimization problem using Lagrange 
Multipliers (more on that [here](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/pca-part-1-the-lagrangian-d66732b573ed)) 
that collates the most contributory variables in order to preserve as much 
information as possible. In other words, creating a line that minimizes the 
sum of squares.

To better understand the variables associated with each principal component, 
we look at the principal component *loadings*. Each variable gets a respective 
weight for each principal component. Using our example data set, we can see that 
average heart rate, BMI, cholesterol levels, and greasy diet greatly contribute 
to PC1. Remember PC1 is the **most important PC** as it explains the greatest 
amount of the variation in the data set.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="https://github.com/ecarlson5683/PCAmethod/blob/main/pics/Fig3.png?raw=true" width="75%" height="75%">
</div>

We can also plot the **loadings** to see the relationship between all the 
variables. To simplify the graph, we will only plot some of the variables. 
Variables with a positive correlation are grouped together, such as obesity, 
cholesterol levels, BMI, and greasy diet. Keep in mind that this is **not** the 
PCA plot. This is the principal components **loadings** plot, and the plotted 
points do **not** represent the individual humans.

</div>

Additionally, a variable's location from the origin is important. The farther 
the variable is from the origin, the stronger its impact on the statistical 
model.

#### How is a PCA conducted? 

1. **Data normalization:** Each variable must be *quantitative*. Since PCA 
yields a feature subspace that maximizes the variance along the axes, it makes 
sense to standardize the data, especially, if it was measured on different 
scales. The unit scale (mean=0 and variance=1) is useful for standardization, 
and requires subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation from 
individual observations of a given variable. 
$$\hat{x} = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s}$$

2. **Covariance matrix:** Compute a symmetric matrix ($d × d$) generated from 
the covariance, a measure of the total variation of two random variables from 
their expected values, between all pairs of variables. The covariance between 
two variables is calculated as:
$$\sigma_{jk} = \frac{1}{n−1} \sum^{n}_{i=1}(x_{ij} − \bar{x}_j)(x_{ik} − \bar{x}_k)$$
The calculation of the covariance matrix can be summarized by:
$$\sum =  \frac{1}{n−1}((X − \bar{x})^T(X − \bar{x}))$$
where $\bar{x}$ is the mean vector $$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum^{n}_{i=1}x_i$$
The mean vector is a $d$-dimensional vector where each value in this vector 
represents the sample mean of a feature column in the data set.

3. **Eigenvectors and eigenvalues:** An **eigenvector** represents a direction 
such as "vertical" or "90 degrees". An **eigenvalue**, on the other hand, is a 
number representing the amount of variance present in the data for a given 
direction. Each eigenvector has its corresponding eigenvalue, which determine 
the direction and magnitude of the new feature space.

4. **Selection of principal components:** There are as many pairs of 
eigenvectors and eigenvalues as the number of variables in the data. In the 
data with lifespan, **not** all the pairs are relevant. So, the eigenvector 
with the highest eigenvalue corresponds to the first principal component (PC1). 
The second principal component (PC2) is the eigenvector with the second highest 
eigenvalue, and so on. The eigenvectors with the lowest eigenvalues bear the 
least information about the distribution of the data; those are the ones that 
can be dropped.

5.  **Construction of the projection matrix:** This step involves re-orienting 
the original multi-dimensional data onto a new 2-dimensional subspace defined 
by the "top 2" principal components. This reorientation is done by multiplying 
the original data by the previously computed eigenvectors.

#### How to read a PCA plot
In this PCA plot, each point is one of the human data. We can see that the data 
are in three distinct clusters. If we color-coordinate the data by age, we can 
see that one cluster is ~110 years old, one cluster is ~80 years old, and one 
cluster is ~50 years old. The blue and green clusters (as well as blue and 
yellow clusters) are different based on PC1. So, the differences in lifespan 
are probably due to factors that heavily influence PC1 (from the loadings, we 
know this includes heart rate, BMI, cholesterol levels, and greasy diet). The 
yellow and green clusters are different based on PC2. So the factors that 
influence PC2 are going to be responsible for differentiating those two 
clusters. Remember that principal components are ranked by how much they 
describe the data, and PC1 is more important than PC2. This means that 
differences along the PC1 axis are larger than similar looking distances along 
PC2.

#### Applications for PCA 
Principal component analysis has a variety of applications in our day-to-day 
life, including finance, image processing, healthcare, and security. In our 
personal research, PCAs are commonly used to better analyze/understand 
population clustering as well as genetic and behavioral analysis. 

## Usage {.unnumbered}

Here, we created a package for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using 
existing functions.

The following code uses the **music** dataset bundled in the {PCAmethod} package 
to run a principal component analysis of several variables that contribute to 
music genre. We can use PCA to determine which variables combine to explain the 
greatest amount of the variance in the data set. 

### Preparing the **music** data set 

#### About the **music** data set

The **music** data set is derived from the [music-genre-classification train.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/purumalgi/music-genre-classification/data?select=train.csv) dataset in ***Kaggle*** and was created during a **MachineHack Hackathon**. 
The dataset includes 17,996 songs with 17 metrics (artist name; track name; 
popularity; ‘danceability’; energy; key; loudness; mode; ‘speechiness’; 
‘acousticness’; ‘instrumentalness’; liveness; valence; tempo; duration in 
milliseconds and time_signature). **Class** is the target variable (genre) 
ranging from 0-11 and indicating Rock, Indie, Alt, Pop, Metal, HipHop, 
Alt_Music, Blues, Acoustic/Folk, Instrumental, Country, or Bollywood.

#### Preliminaries

Load the package dependencies
```{r, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

#### Inspect the **music** data set

Check the data set and determine which variables are qualitative and which are 
quantitative. Also determine which variables would require standardization.
```{r}
head(music)
summary(music)
```

#### Clean the **music** data set

PCA only works with numerical values. So, we need to remove **Artist Name** and 
**Track Name** columns. Also, the **Class** column refers to the genres 
themselves and is our grouping variable.

The code below creates a new data frame with only numeric columns. It also 
removes rows (songs) containing NA values. `nrow()` tells us how many songs 
are left in the cleaned data set.

```{r}
music_clean <- music |> select(-"Artist Name", -"Track Name") |> drop_na()
head(music_clean)
nrow(music_clean)
```

### Use `princomp` function to run PCA

`princomp()` performs a principal components analysis on the given numeric data 
matrix, passed in as argument `x`, and returns the results as an object of class 
**princomp**. The `cor` argument is a logical value indicating whether the 
calculation should use the correlation matrix (standardized) instead of the 
covariance matrix and defaults to `FALSE`.

This function is from the {stats} package in base R.

> NOTE: It usually makes sense to use the correlation matrix, which standardizes 
all measurements to the unit scale and aids in interpretation of the most 
important components, as the base assumption is that all variables are on the 
same scale so greater variance = more explanatory power. However, if all 
variables were measured on the same scale, you could use the covariance matrix.

```{r}
pc <- princomp(x = music_clean[, -1], cor = TRUE)
```

`summary()` returns the three elements of the PCA: [1] Standard Deviation, 
[2] Proportion of Variance, and [3] Cumulative Proportion (of Variance). The 
proportion of variance is often the most important for understanding the 
relative importance of each PC compared to all others.

```{r}
summary(pc)
```

`loadings()` returns the loading scores which tell us which variables are most 
greatly contributing to the differences we see in the groups. We can restrict 
this to the most (or least) explanatory PCs by specifying the columns.

```{r}
pc$loadings[, c(1:4, 13:14)]
```

### Step 3: Use `ggbiplot` and `ggscreeplot` function to visualize PCA

`ggbiplot()` takes the following arguments [1] `pcobj` object returned by a 
function performing PCA, [2] `groups`, an optional factor variable indicating 
the groups that the observations belong to. If provided the points will be 
colored according to groups.

This function is from the {ggbiplot} package created by Vincent Q Vu.
https://github.com/friendly/ggbiplot

Some data cleaning for presentation.

```{r}
music_clean$Class <- as.factor(music_clean$Class)
levels(music_clean$Class) <- c("Rock", "Indie", "Alt", "Pop", "Metal", "Hip Hop", "Alt_Music", "Blues", "Acoustic/Folk", "Instrumental", "Country")
```

Prior to creating our PCA plot, we need to check the scree plot. A scree plot is 
a simple line segment plot that shows the eigenvalues for each individual PC in
a decreasing order. In other words, a scree plot shows the variance explained by
each component in the PCA, starting with the component that explains the most.
Therefore, we would expect to see PC1 with the highest eigenvalue, followed by
PC2, and so on.

```{r}
# ggscreeplot(music_clean)
```

Without grouping, we only see the axes of variation represented by PC1 and PC2. 
Some trends are visible, such as "acousticness" and "energy" moving in 
opposite directions. The circle captures 95% of all data points.

```{r}
p <- ggbiplot(pc, var.scale = 1, point.size=1, alpha=0.05, ellipse = TRUE, circle = TRUE) + ggtitle("PCA of Song Variables") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(), 
  panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
  panel.border = element_blank()) + 
  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(color="black", linewidth = 0.8),
  axis.line.y = element_line(color="black", linewidth = 0.8)) 
p
```

Grouping by Genre (**Class**), we see much clearer clusters. While most genres 
overlap around the origin, some distinctions are possible. For example, the 
Blues and Acoustic/Folk genres stand out fairly well. Ellipses capture 95% of data points for each group.

```{r}
ggbiplot(pc, var.scale = 1, varname.adjust = 1.2, point.size=1, alpha=0.05, groups=music_clean$Class, ellipse = TRUE, ellipse.linewidth = 0.5, ellipse.alpha = 0.1, circle = TRUE, varname.color = "darkred") + labs(fill = "Genre", color="Genre") + 
  ggtitle("PCA of Song Variables") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(), 
  panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
  panel.border = element_blank()) + 
  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(color="black", linewidth = 0.8),
  axis.line.y = element_line(color="black", linewidth = 0.8)) 
```

How much of the variance in the data set is explained by PC1? By PC2? Which 
variables contribute to PC1 (and explain the greatest amount of variance)? 

We can also specify which PCs we plot using the `choices` argument. Below, PC 2 and 3 are selected. Clusters are far less apparent.

```{r}
ggbiplot(pc, var.scale = 1, choices=2:3, varname.adjust = 1.2, point.size=1, alpha=0.05, groups=music_clean$Class, ellipse = TRUE, ellipse.linewidth = 0.5, ellipse.alpha = 0.1, circle = TRUE, varname.color = "darkred") + labs(fill = "Genre", color="Genre") +
  ggtitle("PCA of Song Variables") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(), 
  panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
  panel.border = element_blank()) + 
  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(color="black", linewidth = 0.8),
  axis.line.y = element_line(color="black", linewidth = 0.8)) 
```

And here is PC 3 vs PC 4. Note that the difference in proportion of variation is starting to become quite small.

```{r}
ggbiplot(pc, var.scale = 1, choices=3:4, varname.adjust = 1.2, point.size=1, alpha=0.05, groups=music_clean$Class, ellipse = TRUE, ellipse.linewidth = 0.5, ellipse.alpha = 0.1, circle = TRUE, varname.color = "darkred") + labs(fill = "Genre", color="Genre") + 
  ggtitle("PCA of Song Variables") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(), 
  panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
  panel.border = element_blank()) + 
  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(color="black", linewidth = 0.8),
  axis.line.y = element_line(color="black", linewidth = 0.8)) 
```

Here are the final two PCs, which make up only 3.3% of the total variation. 

```{r}
ggbiplot(pc, var.scale = 1, choices=13:14, varname.adjust = 1.2, point.size=1, alpha=0.05, groups=music_clean$Class, ellipse = TRUE, ellipse.linewidth = 0.5, ellipse.alpha = 0.1, circle = TRUE, varname.color = "darkred") + labs(fill = "Genre", color="Genre") + 
  ggtitle("PCA of Song Variables") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(), 
  panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
  panel.border = element_blank()) + 
  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(color="black", linewidth = 0.8),
  axis.line.y = element_line(color="black", linewidth = 0.8)) 
```

Finally, we can display PC1 against PC14. Here, we can see that the axes are nearly all horizontal due to the large difference in variation explained by PC1 compared to PC14. 

```{r}
ggbiplot(pc, var.scale = 1, choices=c(1, 14), varname.adjust = 1.2, point.size=1, alpha=0.05, groups=music_clean$Class, ellipse = TRUE, ellipse.linewidth = 0.5, ellipse.alpha = 0.1, circle = TRUE, varname.color = "darkred") + labs(fill = "Genre", color="Genre") + 
  ggtitle("PCA of Song Variables") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(), 
  panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
  panel.border = element_blank()) + 
  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(color="black", linewidth = 0.8),
  axis.line.y = element_line(color="black", linewidth = 0.8)) 
```

## Add a Data Directory and Data

The **music** dataset is used for example purposes. It is derived from the [music-genre-classification train.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/purumalgi/music-genre-classification/data?select=train.csv) dataset in ***Kaggle*** and was created during a **MachineHack Hackathon**. The dataset includes 17,996 songs with 17 metrics (artist name; track name; popularity; ‘danceability’; energy; key; loudness; mode; ‘speechiness’; ‘acousticness’; ‘instrumentalness’; liveness; valence; tempo; duration in milliseconds and time_signature). **Class** is the target variable (genre) ranging from 0-10 and indicating Rock, Indie, Alt, Pop, Metal, HipHop, Alt_Music, Blues, Acoustic/Folk, Instrumental, Country, or Bollywood.
